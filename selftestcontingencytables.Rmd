# Contingency tables and correlation measures

The self-test allows you to check your knowledge of contingency tables as well as the two measures of association odds ratio and Pearson's corrected contingency coefficient. The test contains three automatically generated tasks that can be completed in any order and time. The entered results can be reset at any time (**Start over**) and the test can be regenerated (**RStudio: Run Document**).

## Task 1

```{r, results = "hide"}
# Generate the first data set for task 1
## Total number of observations
n <- sample(5000:15000, 1)
## Characteristic X is generated
x <- rbinom(n, 1, .24)

## Creation of the data set
d <- as.data.frame(x)
## Characteristic Y is generated
d$y <- ifelse(d$x == 0, rbinom(NROW(d[d$x == 0,]), 1, .014), rbinom(NROW(d[d$x == 1,]), 1, .4))

## Creating the contingency table
t <- table(d[, 1], d[, 2])
## Calculation of the marginal frequencies of X and Y
t_x <- margin.table(t, 1)
t_y <- margin.table(t, 2)

## Calculation of the odds ratio
t_or <- round(oddsratio(t, method = "wald")$measure[-1,1], digits = 3)
```

In one study, `r n` patients, among them `r t_x[2]` smokers, were recorded. We counted `r t[2,2]` patients who smoke and have had a heart attack. However, `r t[1,2]` patients also suffered a heart attack without smoking. `r t_y[1]` patients did not suffer a heart attack. Of interest is a possible connection between smoking and a heart attack.

|                 | **Heart attack** | **No Heart attack** |  $\sum{}$  |
|:---------------:|:------------:|:-------------------:|:----------:|
|   **Smokers**   |  `r t[2,2]`  |        $?_1$        | `r t_x[2]` |
| **Non-smokers** |  `r t[1,2]`  |        $?_2$        |   $?_3$    |
|    $\sum{}$     |    $?_4$     |     `r t_y[1]`      |   `r n`    |

**(a)** First complete the contingency table by indicating the values that are in the places with "$?_x$". Check your results with the entry in the text boxes.

One study observed `r n` patients. Overweight (BMI $\geq$ 25, $<$ 30) and hypertension (blood pressure $\geq$ 140/90 mmHg) were measured. Hypertension was present in `r t_y[2]` of the patients. `r t[2,2]` of them were identified as having both obesity and elevated blood pressure. In `r t[1,1]` of the patients neither overweight nor hypertension was present.

### **(a)** Create a contingency table based on the observations. Check your results by answering the questions.

```{r KT2_1}
  # Question element: Task 2, Question 1
  question_text(
  "How many patients are not overweight??",
  answer(paste(t_x[1]), correct = T),
  allow_retry = T,
  correct = "correct!",
  incorrect = "Unfortunately not correct",
  placeholder = "Enter answer here...",
  submit_button = "Submit reply",
  try_again_button = "try again"
)
```

```{r KT2_2}
# Question element: Task 2, Question 2
question_text(
  "How many patients have hypertension but are not overweight??",
  answer(paste(t[1,2]), correct = T),
  allow_retry = T,
  correct = "correct!",
  incorrect = "Unfortunately not correct",
  placeholder = "Enter answer here...",
  submit_button = "Submit reply",
  try_again_button = "try again"
)
```

```{r KT2_3}
# Question element: Task 2, Question 3
question_text(
  "How many patients in total do not have hypertension??",
  answer(paste(t_y[1]), correct = T),
  allow_retry = T,
  correct = "correct!",
  incorrect = "Unfortunately not correct",
  placeholder = "Enter answer here...",
  submit_button = "Submit reply",
  try_again_button = "try again"
)
```

**(b)** Calculate the Pearson's corrected contingency coefficient $K_{korr}$. Interpret your result.

```{r KK2}
# Question element: Task 2, Question 4
question_text(
  "Result of $K_{korr}$:",
  message = "Round to the third decimal place and use a dot as the decimal separator.",
  answer(paste(t_cc), correct = T),
  allow_retry = T,
  correct = "correct!",
  incorrect = "Unfortunately not correct",
  placeholder = "Enter answer here...",
  submit_button = "Submit reply",
  try_again_button = "try again"
)
```

```{r KK2_I}
# Question element: Task 2, Question 5
question_radio(
  "How strong is the correlation between obesity and hypertension?",
  answer("no correlation"),
  answer("weak correlation"),
  answer("medium correlation", correct = T),
  answer("strong correlation"),
  answer("complete correlation"),
  allow_retry = T,
  correct = "correct!",
  incorrect = "Unfortunately not correct",
  submit_button = "Submit reply",
  try_again_button = "try again"
)
```

## Task 3

```{r, results = "hide"}
# Generate the third data set for task 3
## Total number of observations
n <- sample(1500:7500, 1)
## Characteristic X is generated
x <- rbinom(n, 1, .5)

## Creation of the data set
d <- as.data.frame(x)
## Characteristic Y is generated
d$y <- ifelse(d$x == 0, rbinom(NROW(d[d$x == 0,]), 1, .45), rbinom(NROW(d[d$x == 1,]), 1, .75))

## Creating the contingency table
t <- table(d[, 1], d[, 2])
## Calculation of the marginal frequencies of X and Y
t_x <- margin.table(t, 1)
t_y <- margin.table(t, 2)

## Calculation of the odds ratio
t_or <- round(oddsratio(t, method = "wald")$measure[-1,1], digits = 3)
```

In a study with `r n` patients:in suffering from a disease, the healing success (cured, not cured) after administration of a drug in low and high dosage (1 and 2 pills per day, respectively) was investigated. The results of the study were recorded in the following contingency table:

|            | **not cured** | **cured**  |
|:----------:|:-------------:|:----------:|
| **1 pill** |  `r t[1,1]`   | `r t[1,2]` |
| **2 pill** |  `r t[2,1]`   | `r t[2,2]` |

**(a)** Determine the edge frequencies of the contingency table. Check your results with the entry in the text boxes.

```{r KT3_1}
# Question element: Task 3, Question 1
question_text(
  "How many patients have received the drug with the low dosage??",
  answer(paste(t_x[1]), correct = T),
  allow_retry = T,
  correct = "correct!",
  incorrect = "Unfortunately not correct",
  placeholder = "Enter answer here...",
  submit_button = "Submit reply",
  try_again_button = "try again"

**(b)** Investigate the relationship between drug dosage and cure success using the odds ratio.

```{r OR3}
# Question element: Task 3, Question 5
question_text(
  "What is the chance of being cured among patients receiving a low dosage compared to patients receiving the higher dosage of the drug??",
  message = "Round to the third decimal place and use a period as the decimal separator.",
  answer(paste(t_or), correct = T),
  allow_retry = T,
  correct = "correct!",
  incorrect = "Unfortunately not correct",
  placeholder = "Enter answer here...",
